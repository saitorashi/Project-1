    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Hypertext" refers to links that connect webpages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. HTML describes the structure of a web page. HTML5, the current standard for HTML, has roughly 100 tags. HTML has tree structure consisting of branches and nodes.</p>
      <h1>HTML elements</h1>
       <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags."</p> 
     <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
       <p>Tags consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".</p>
    <h1>Web Browsers</h1>
      <p>Many browsers have default styles for the appearance of the document based on the meaning of the tag. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
